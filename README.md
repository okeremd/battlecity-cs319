Description of the Battlecity
General:
It is a multiplayer game that each user have control of their one tank. Player's objection is surviving until no other player stands.
Maps:
The edges (outer boundaries) of the maps are built by unbreakable square objects, while there might be breakable squares inside the map.
Controls:
Each player has 4 different keys to control the movement of their tank and one key to fire. The direction of fire will be depend on the last movement key used.
// header required (maybe gameplay ?)
The player will die if his/her tank is shooted by another tank. The bullet of tanks will travel in a straight line until they hit an object (wall or tank). Tanks would not pass through walls or each other. If a wall is breakable, the bullets will destroy it in certain amount of shots (depends on the wall type).
