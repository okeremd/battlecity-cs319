Description of the Project

In the project we are going to implement classic atari game "Battle City".
Our aim is to create this game using the principles of object oriented programming.
The game is going to be implemented by using JAVAFX( can be changed in future)

Description of the Battlecity

General:
It is a multiplayer game, where each user has control of their one tank. GameObject.GameObject.TankObjects.Player's objection is surviving until all other tanks are destroyed

Maps:
The edges (outer boundaries) of the maps are built by unbreakable square objects. In addition, there might be breakable squares inside the map.

Controls:
Each player has 4 different keys to control the movement of their tank and one key to fire. Up/ Down key to move forward/back, left/right key to move to the left/right and space bar for shooting. The direction of fire will depend on the last movement key used.

Gameplay:
The player will die if his/her tank is shot by another tank. Each tank has three lives. The bullets of tanks go in a straight line until they hit an object (wall or tank). Tanks do not pass through walls or each other. If a wall is breakable, the bullets will destroy it in certain amount of shots (depends on the wall type).
